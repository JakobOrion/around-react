# Project 10

**by Jakob Pfefferkorn**

### Around The U.S. - React

Project 10 begins the process of porting the Around the U.S. website from the previous sprints to React. 

Current functionality includes:
* Displaying profile information and location cards pulled from API
* Buttons for editing avatar, profile info, and adding cards open their respective popups
* Clicking a card image opens the full size image popup
* Popups can be closed by clicking the "x" button

The remaining functionality will be ported in the next sprint.

### Some of the new tools and techniques learned this sprint

* Create React App
* React components
* JSX
* React Hooks
* Declarative vs Imperative approaches
