# Project 11

**by Jakob Bohn**

### Around The U.S. - React

Project 11 continues porting the Around the U.S. website from the previous sprints to React. 

Current functionality includes:
* Displaying profile information and location cards pulled from API
* Buttons for editing avatar, profile info, and adding cards open their respective popups
* Clicking a card image opens the full size image popup
* Popups can be closed by clicking the "x" button or anywhere outside of the popup container, as well as when the escape key is pressed
* The edit profile, edit avatar, and add place forms all work
* Delete buttons only appear on the cards added by the user
* When delete button is clicked, a confirmation popup appears before removing the card
* Saving indicator appears while forms are submitting
* Ported form validation


### Some of the new tools and techniques learned this sprint

* Create React App
* React components
* JSX
* React Hooks
* Declarative vs Imperative approaches
